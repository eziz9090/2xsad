                    In this project, we used skills that we learned from codecademy. We started this with creative ideas and outlining the website's structure. Each team member was assigned to do one part of this wonderful project. Though at the end, we all made changes. I would also like to mention that we all helped each other as a team if one of us faced some issues.

                    We faced several issues, one of them was implementing the carousel without being able to use any external libraries. However thankfully, our dear team member Aziz managed to do it on his own.

                <p class="content-webproject" class="teamwork-text">
                    Our team arranged daily calls and meetings throughout the week to discuss difficulties that each of us faced. This made us become closer as a team.

                    Before starting this whole process, we first made a plan. We wanted it to be creative and simple. Thankfully, in the end, we all reached a mutual agreement.

                <p class="content-webproject">
                    We used our knowladge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this homework. Each member was assigned to do 1 part of this project: <br>
                    Aziz = index.html <br>
                    Sabir = team-members.html <br>
                    Davud = hour-of-code.hrml <br>
                    Samira = web-project.html <br>
                    We decided that we would keep code-artist to the end and write it all together. Obviously, we all faced some problems but at the end we overcame.

                <p class="content-webproject">
                    We collaborated through GitHub, which helped us to track changes and avoid problems in the code. VSCode was our main editor, we used its live server feature to preview our work.

                <p class="content-webproject">
                    Once we finished, we tested it several times and fixed all errors. We each gave feedbacks, which helped us to improve it.

                    Overall, this project was a valuable lesson, experince, and memory for all of us. It taught us the importance of working as a team, being patient with each other, compromising, problem-solving and persistance. Despite the challanges, we were able to complete the project and gain a deeper understanding of web development.
