            <h2 class="hour-of-code-h2">The Mission and First Step</h2>
            <p class="hour-of-code-p">In hour-of-code we should teach codding to 20 children who are
                don't have any information about it. Our first mission was to find 20 participants.
                Instructors advised us to find students from neighborhood but we could not
                find them, that is why we went to the course which included 5-9 class students and
                they learn Azerbaijani languge so they did not know any information about
                our topic. After finding children we should have provided them with the needed equipment, so we went to the school where previously Davud was studying.
            </p>
            <h2 class="hour-of-code-h2">The Second Step</h2>
            <p class="hour-of-code-p">In class firstly we explained to children what is our aim, then
                Sabir and Davud started the presentation about ADA university and persuaded children 
            to come to ADA. Their eyes were full of enthusiasm and with every new piece of information about the university they were getting more involved.</p>

            <h2 class="hour-of-code-h2">The Third Step</h2>
            <p class="hour-of-code-p"> Davud provided the basic information to participants about codding. Then the whole class started working.</p>

            <h2 class="hour-of-code-h2">The Fourth Step</h2>
            <p class="hour-of-code-p">Sabir,Aziz, and Samira dealed with children individually and Davud worked with the rest 
            of them because there were 20 computers for 26 participants.</p>

                        but then we managed it all by telling them that this way we will not be able to teach them anything.</p>
